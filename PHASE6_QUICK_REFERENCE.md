  Your  Phase  Options



 OPTION : Design System                                  

 What:        Storybook +  components + design tokens     
 Why:         Premium UX, x faster UI development         
 Effort:       days ( dev)                                
 ROI:         Highest (every UI change benefits)            
 Start:       Branch: feat/design-system                    
 First Result: Friday                                       



 OPTION : Kubernetes                                     

 What:        Helm chart + Ks manifests + HA setup         
 Why:         Enterprise deployment, scaling                
 Effort:       days ( dev)                                
 ROI:         High (enterprise requirement)                 
 Start:       Branch: feat/kubernetes-helm                  
 First Result: Friday                                       



 OPTION : Integrations                                   

 What:        OpenCTI + Cortex + webhooks + queue           
 Why:         Multi-platform orchestration hub              
 Effort:       days ( devs)                              
 ROI:         Medium (future-oriented, high complexity)     
 Start:       Branch: feat/sync-engine-advanced             
 First Result:  days                                      



 OPTION : Security                                       

 What:        Headers + rate limiting + Prometheus + Grafana
 Why:         Enterprise audit readiness, compliance        
 Effort:       days (- devs)                             
 ROI:         Medium (compliance enabler)

 First Result:  days                                       



 OPTION : ALL  IN PARALLEL  (RECOMMENDED)              

 Team:         developers (Design + Ks + Integrations)    
 Timeline:    - days (vs  sequential)                 
 First Results: Design System + Ks by Friday              
             Integrations + Security next  weeks          
 Vision:      / → / in  days                   
 Best For:    Aggressive timeline, full team commitment

  How to Decide ( seconds)

Ask yourself:

. Is visual excellence important? → YES → Start Design System 

. Do enterprises need Ks? → YES → Start Kubernetes 

. Do we need multi-platform? → YES → Start Integrations 

. Is compliance urgent? → YES → Start Security 

. Have  devs available? → YES → Start All  in Parallel

  Decision by Role


PRODUCT MANAGER:
→ Recommend: All in Parallel 
   (Vision alignment from  →  in  days)

CEO/FOUNDER:
→ Recommend: Ks + Security 
   (Enterprise readiness, sales enablement)

DESIGN LEAD:
→ Recommend: Design System 
   (Brand consistency, team velocity)

ENGINEERING LEAD:
→ Recommend: Kubernetes + Integrations 
   (Scalability, ecosystem)

SALES:
→ Recommend: Security + Kubernetes 
   (Closes enterprise deals)
