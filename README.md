## 🎯 Vue d'ensemble

**OpenRisk** is a modern, enterprise-grade **Risk Management Platform** that transforms how organizations identify, assess, mitigate, and monitor risks. Built with a scalable microservices architecture, OpenRisk enables teams to move beyond spreadsheets and legacy systems into a seamless, automated risk management experience.

### 🎯 What OpenRisk Enables

OpenRisk allows every organization to:
- ✅ **Identify** IT & security risks
- ✅ **Score & Prioritize** risks based on impact and probability
- ✅ **Track** mitigation plans and action items
- ✅ **Monitor** trends in real-time with interactive dashboards

### 💡 Designed For

- **CTO & CISO** - Strategic risk oversight and compliance
- **DevSecOps** - Integrated security in CI/CD pipelines
- **Security Analysts** - Risk assessment and investigation
- **Compliance Teams** - Audit trails and governance

### 📈 Key Advantages

- ⚡ **Automated Risk Assessment** - Reduce manual evaluation time
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboards** - Real-time risk visualization
- 🐳 **Easy Deployment** - Docker & Kubernetes ready
- 🔐 **Enterprise Security** - RBAC, SSO, audit logging
- 📈 **Scalable Architecture** - Microservices-ready

### Key Capabilities
- 🎲 **Risk Assessment** - Comprehensive risk identification and scoring
- 🛡️ **Mitigation Tracking** - Monitor and track risk mitigations in real-time
- 🔐 **Enterprise Security** - RBAC, audit logging, OAuth2/SAML2 SSO
- 🗂️ **Asset Inventory** - Track assets, their criticality and dependencies
- 📋 **Compliance Management** - Manage controls, evidence and compliance reports
- 💶 **Financial Risk Quantification** - Quantify exposure using SLE, ARO, ALE and ROSI

### 💶 Financial Risk Quantification (CRQ)

![Financial Quantification dashboard, on demonstration data](./docs/assets/crq-dashboard.png)

*The Financial Quantification dashboard (`/analytics/financial`), shown on the built-in
demonstration dataset (`DEMO_MODE=true`), not on a customer's data. Available from the
**Pro** plan.*

Each risk is quantified FAIR-style: single loss expectancy (SLE), annual rate of occurrence
(ARO), annualised loss expectancy (ALE = SLE × ARO), residual ALE and return on security
investment (ROSI). Amounts are computed in XAF and presented in XAF, XOF, EUR, USD, NGN, MAD,
GHS or ZAR. The dashboard aggregates them into one view for the CFO and the CISO
(`backend/pkg/crq`).

### 🌍 African Regulatory Catalogues

| Catalogue | Source instrument | Controls |
|---|---|---|
| **COBAC (CEMAC)**: internal control of credit institutions | Règlement COBAC R-2016/04 | 45 |
| **BCEAO / UEMOA**: payment systems | Règlement n°15/2002/CM/UEMOA | 35 |
| **ANTIC (Cameroon)**: cybersecurity | Loi n°2010/012 | 25 |

Every control cites the article it derives from (`backend/pkg/compliance/catalog_*.go`). The
control descriptions are synthesised rewordings, not the regulatory text. Have them reviewed
by a qualified professional before relying on them in a real audit.

### 🔎 Asset Discovery

**10 collectors**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, Docker, VMware vCenter, Active
Directory, Microsoft 365, GitHub and GitLab. **Plus an on-premise Agent** (nmap) for networks
the platform cannot reach directly (`backend/internal/scanner`).

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git
- 4GB RAM, 2GB disk space

### Self-hosting — one command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opendefender/OpenRisk.git
cd OpenRisk
./install.sh
```

That is the whole procedure. The installer generates the RS256 keypair and every
secret, starts PostgreSQL, Redis, the API and the frontend, waits for health, and
**prints the credentials of the administrator it created**:

```
[openrisk] ✅ OpenRisk is up.
[openrisk]    • App:  http://localhost:3000
[openrisk]    • API:  http://localhost:8080/api/v1
[openrisk] Sign in with:
[openrisk]    • Email:    admin@opendefender.io
[openrisk]    • Password: <32 random characters, different on every install>
```

No file is edited by hand at any point. Re-running the installer keeps your
configuration, your keys and that account.

A CI job ([`selfhost-install.yml`](.github/workflows/selfhost-install.yml)) runs
this flow monthly on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 VM and signs in with the printed
credentials. It has **not yet had a green run** — the defects that kept it red
are fixed in #328; the flow was verified by hand on a clean stack on 2026-09-09.

Full guide, including what a self-hosted instance is entitled to, upgrades and
backups: **[docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md)**.

### Local development

Working on OpenRisk itself (hot reload, test databases, seeded fixtures) is a
different setup: see **[docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md)**.

### ⚠️ Security: no default credentials

OpenRisk ships no default password. The first administrator gets the
`INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set, or one generated on first boot and written
to a `0600` file, never to the logs (see [docs/SELF_HOSTING.md](docs/SELF_HOSTING.md#the-first-administrator)).
The compose files refuse to start without their database and cache passwords.

An instance first started before this change may still have `admin123` on
`admin@opendefender.io`: the backend logs a `SECURITY WARNING` at boot until
the password is changed.

To report a vulnerability, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

**Password Requirements** (enforced server-side at registration):
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least three of: lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols
- Common and predictable passwords are rejected
- Preferably generated with a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)

## 🔐 Security

OpenRisk implements enterprise-grade security:

- **Authentication**: JWT tokens (RS256) with expiration and JTI blacklist
- **Authorization**: RBAC with permission matrices and resource-level granularity
- **Password Hashing**: Argon2id (m=64MB, t=3, p=4) - never SHA256 or bcrypt alone
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data at rest
- **Audit Trail**: Complete audit logging for all operations (append-only)
- **SSO**: OAuth2 (Google, GitHub) and SAML2 support
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and per-tenant quotas across the API, with a stricter throttle on credential endpoints
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy and nosniff
- **Input Validation**: Server-side request validation (go-playground/validator); Zod on the frontend
- **Default Credentials**: Never hardcoded - always use environment variables
- **Secrets Management**: Support for external secret managers (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)

⚠️ **Security Best Practices:**
- Rotate credentials and API keys regularly
- Use strong passwords (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Enable MFA/2FA for all user accounts
- Keep dependencies updated regularly
- Run security scans (TruffleHog, Snyk, Trivy)
- Monitor audit logs for suspicious activity

See [ADVANCED_PERMISSIONS.md](docs/ADVANCED_PERMISSIONS.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security documentation.
