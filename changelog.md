## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **M4 — Official compliance report (PDF, 1-click).** New `GET /compliance/frameworks/{id}/report?locale=fr|en`
  streams a print-ready PDF for a framework: cover identity (organization, framework, date, requester),
  executive summary (compliance %, per-status breakdown, progress bar) and a paginated controls table
  (reference, name, colored status, evidence count, source citation). All data strictly tenant-scoped.
  Pure renderer in `backend/pkg/report` (fully unit-tested, no DB/HTTP), `GenerateComplianceReportUseCase`
  in the application layer, `CountEvidencesByFramework` repo method (single grouped query), and a
  "PDF report" button on the Compliance page (FR/EN). Serves the COBAC/BCEAO/ISO one-click statement goal.
