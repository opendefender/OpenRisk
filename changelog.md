# Changelog

All notable changes to OpenRisk will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **M4 — Official compliance report (PDF, 1-click).** New `GET /compliance/frameworks/{id}/report?locale=fr|en`
  streams a print-ready PDF for a framework: cover identity (organization, framework, date, requester),
  executive summary (compliance %, per-status breakdown, progress bar) and a paginated controls table
  (reference, name, colored status, evidence count, source citation). All data strictly tenant-scoped.
  Pure renderer in `backend/pkg/report` (fully unit-tested, no DB/HTTP), `GenerateComplianceReportUseCase`
  in the application layer, `CountEvidencesByFramework` repo method (single grouped query), and a
  "PDF report" button on the Compliance page (FR/EN). Serves the COBAC/BCEAO/ISO one-click statement goal.

### Planned
- Board Report mensuel (IA, human-in-the-loop, FCFA) — the second half of M4
- Multi-tenant support
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Slack/Teams notifications
- Jira integration

## [1.1.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-23

> Release-candidate hardening pass (branch `release/hardening-rc1`, stacked on
> `release/1.0-rc1`). Focus: reliability, security, multi-tenant isolation,
> performance and a green test suite — no new features.
>
> ⚠️ Versioning note: GitHub already carries `1.0.0`–`1.0.8` tags/releases that
> predate most of the current product. They do **not** reflect today's feature
> set. This RC proposes restarting the line at `1.1.0-rc.1`; the stale releases
> should be curated/relabelled (see `docs/RC_HARDENING_REPORT.md`).

### Security
- **Cross-tenant leak fixed** in bulk operations: `/bulk-operations` ran
  delete/update/export/assign filtered only by a user-supplied query with no
  `tenant_id` scope (a bulk delete could hit every tenant). Now tenant-scoped
  end-to-end with isolation tests. (Earlier RC also fixed the analytics/dashboard
  aggregation leak.)
- **Rate limiter is now Redis-backed** so brute-force protection on
  `/auth/login|register|refresh` holds across a horizontally-scaled deployment
  (was per-instance in-memory); degrades gracefully to in-memory if Redis is down.
- Legacy HS256 `/auth/legacy/*` login surface removed; default `admin123` seed
  refused in production (earlier RC).

### Performance
- **Route-based code splitting** (React.lazy): initial JS bundle 1.56 MB → ~651 kB.
- **Composite DB indexes** (migration 0039) on hot `(tenant_id, …)` access paths
  across risks/vulnerabilities/assets/compliance_controls/incidents/mitigations/audit_events.

### Fixed
- **Edit-Risk "Save" was broken in production**: the form declared `tags` as an
  array while the input produced a string, so Zod rejected every save. Fixed.
- Frontend test suite: 7 failing tests + 2 unloadable files → **43 passed / 0 failed**.
- `TestRiskCRUDFlow` green (sqlite DDL re-synced) — backend **36 pkg OK / 0 FAIL**.

### Accessibility
- Shared `Input` now associates `<label>`/`<input>` (screen readers + testability).

### RBAC
- Real per-route `PermissionRoute` guard wired from the shared nav permission map.

### Removed (dead code / duplicates)
- `ai_risk_predictor_service.go` (never wired), tenant-blind `risk_repo.go`,
  duplicate `components/CreateRiskModal.tsx`, dead `shared/fixtures.ts`, and two
  legacy Jest test files.
