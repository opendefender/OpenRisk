## 📌 Next Immediate Action (Start Tomorrow)

### **Priority: Start Design System** 🎨

**Why**: 
- Enables professional, consistent UX (required for premium positioning)
- Required before scaling frontend team
- Low risk, high visibility impact
- Unblocks weeks 2-4 work (can parallelize)

**First Sprint (2 days)**:
1. Set up Storybook in frontend
2. Create token system (Tailwind theme)
3. Build 5 foundational components:
   - Button (4 variants)
   - Input (3 types)
   - Card (2 layouts)
   - Badge (5 colors)
   - Alert (4 types)
4. Integrate with 1 existing page

**Branch**: `feat/design-system`

**Expected Deliverables**:
- `frontend/storybook/` directory with config
- `frontend/src/components/` organized by atomic design
- 5 documented components with A11y
- Updated 1-2 pages using new components

---

## 🔄 Alternative Priority: Kubernetes First

**If** you need to support enterprise deployment immediately, **then** prioritize Helm over Design System:

1. Create Helm chart (week 1-2)
2. Deploy to staging K8s cluster
3. Validate all services work
4. Document deployment runbook

**After K8s stable**, then Design System provides polish.

---

## Questions for Direction

Based on your OpenRisk vision, which priority matters most right now?

1. **Design System** → Polish + UX parity with linear.app/notion ✨
2. **Kubernetes/Helm** → Enterprise deployment readiness 🚀
3. **Advanced Integrations** → Ecosystem connectivity 🔗
4. **Security Hardening** → Enterprise compliance 🔒

Or **run all 4 in parallel** with:
- Week 1-2: Design System (1 dev) + Kubernetes (1 dev)
- Week 3-4: Integrations (2 devs) + Security (1 dev)

---
