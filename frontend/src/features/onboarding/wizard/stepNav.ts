/**
 * Save-then-navigate, shared by every step (#438 criterion 4).
 *
 * Three properties, and each one is a criterion rather than a preference:
 *
 *   • THE DATA IS PERSISTED BEFORE THE NEXT STEP RENDERS. No optimistic advance.
 *     This is the one place ABSOLUTE RULE #10 (optimistic updates on critical
 *     mutations) is deliberately overridden — do not "fix" it. An optimistic
 *     tunnel that fails silently strands the user in an app they cannot enter,
 *     because the guard is reading the server, not the client.
 *   • THE TARGET COMES FROM THE SERVER. `state.steps` already has auto-skipped
 *     steps removed, and the response's `current_step` is authoritative. Walking
 *     the canonical five here would navigate straight onto a hidden step.
 *   • A FAILURE KEEPS THE USER ON THE STEP WITH THEIR ANSWERS AND A RETRY. The
 *     last attempt is held so `retry()` replays it verbatim; nothing is cleared,
 *     nothing is re-typed.
 *   • FORWARD FROM THE LAST VISIBLE STEP IS THE EXIT, NOT A CURSOR MOVE (#685).
 *     The server clamps the cursor to the last step, so "advance" alone reloads
 *     the same screen, and the guard keeps every route pointing at it until
 *     onboarding.completed is true. The step is saved, THEN the tunnel is
 *     completed, THEN the user lands on the posture reveal. "Last" is read from
 *     the server's visible steps, so it holds when `cover` is auto-skipped.
 *     The exit was first written in cd190a1 and lost in the merge c12bc37; it
 *     lives here now so no single step can drop it again.
