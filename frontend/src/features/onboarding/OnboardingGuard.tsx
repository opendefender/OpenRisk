// The route guard (spec §4): the app is unreachable until the signup wizard is
// finished, and the wizard is unreachable once it is.
//
// The authority is the SERVER's onboarding.completed, never a local flag — the
// same principle as the activation checklist. Two consequences worth stating:
//
//   • While the state is loading we render NOTHING but a quiet placeholder. A
//     guard that guesses "not completed" during the first fetch would bounce
//     every returning user through the wizard on every cold load.
//   • If the state cannot be fetched at all, the guard FAILS OPEN. Locking an
//     existing customer out of their own GRC platform because an onboarding
//     endpoint is down would be a far worse failure than showing the app to
//     someone who has not finished a wizard.

 *
 * A completed user goes to the POSTURE REVEAL, not to `landing`.
 *
 * This used to send them to `data.landing` — the screen derived from their
 * chosen goal — which quietly defeated the whole of #438: the last step calls
 * `POST /onboarding/complete`, this wrapper saw `completed: true` on the very
 * next render and redirected before the reveal could mount. Five screens
 * collected facts and the user was dropped on a register, which is the exact
 * activation cliff the issue exists to remove.
 *
 * `landing` is where they go FROM the reveal, and the reveal offers it.
